# Learning Process 
## 1. How to Learn Faster with the Feynman Technique
### Question 1
#### What is the Feynman Technique? Paraphrase the video in your own words.
Feynman Technique says that "Learning is not until done till you explain it properly".Explaining the complex or tough concept in speakable or story telling way that even complete biginner can understand it properly. 
### Question 2
#### What are the different ways to implement this technique in your learning process?
+ The first step is to choose the concept you want to understand. Take a blank piece of paper and write the name of that concept at the top of the page.
+ The second step is to write out an explanation, as if you were teaching it to someone who didn’t understand the subject. This is crucial because in explaining to yourself the ideas you already understand, as well as the ones you don’t, you gain a better understanding and pinpoint exactly the details you don’t understand.
+ Whenever you get stuck, go back to the reference materials, lectures or a teacher 
assistant and re-read or re-learn the material until you do get it enough that you can 
explain it on the paper.

### Question 3
#### Paraphrase the video in detail in your own words.
She began trying to answer that student’s question, “How did she changed her brain?”, she began reaching out to top professors from around the world, people who not only had knowledge of their difficult areas of expertise, but also who could teach effectively. And she asked them. she said, “How did you learn? And how do you teach, so others could learn?” What she found was the way they learned, and e way they taught was often similar to the way she learned and she taught. It was almost like this kind of shared fraternal handshake. But we often didn’t know why we did what we did. So she  began researching neuroscience and cognitive psychology, and reaching out to talk to top experts of those fields.
Here is what she found, the keys to learning effectively. Now as we know, the brain is enormously complex. But we can simplify its operation into two fundamentally different modes. The first is just  the focus mode. The focus mode is just like it sounds like: you turn your attention to something and boom. It’s on. But the second mode is a little different. It’s a relaxed set of neural states that  the diffuse mode. It’s a number of resting states.
### Question 4
#### What are some of the steps that you can take to improve your learning process?
1. Underline the Key Points
2. Prepare Your Own Study Notes
3. Make a Study Plan and Stay Organized
4. Collaborate with Study Partners 
5. Take Regular Study Breaks
6. Recall Your Learning

### Question 5
#### Your key takeaways from the video? Paraphrase your understanding.
Kaufman says:
“You can go from knowing nothing about any skill that you can think of.  Want to learn a language? Want to learn how to draw? Want to learn how to juggle flaming chainsaws?

If you put 20 hours of focused deliberate practice into that thing,  you will be astounded.  Astounded at how good you are.  20 hours is doable, that’s about 45 minutes a day for about a month.  Even skipping a couple days, here and there."
The first is to deconstruct the skill.  Decide exactly what you want to be able to do when you’re done, and then look into the skill and break it down into smaller pieces.  Most of the things that we think of as skills are actually big bundles of skills that require all sorts of different things. 
Take action and get started.  Start practicing the new skill you want to learn so that you can generate feedback and start correcting yourself.  You need to start to recognize what good looks like or what good feels like, so you can change your approach as necessary.  This is how you will create your learning loop.


### Question 6
#### What are some of the steps that you can while approaching a new topic?
1. Create a schedule with fixed study times -Choose a time that fits in with your natural daily routine. For example, morning people get the most out of study by starting early. Others only pick up steam later in the day, in which case it’s best to plan study time in the afternoon.
2. Start with core skills - Most skills consist of core skills (core competences) and secondary skills. But what’s the difference? The core skills are essential to learning a new skill, whereas secondary skills are useful, but not essential to mastering this skill.
3. Take things step by step - Acquiring and mastering a new skill is often a long and complex process. That’s why it’s worth your while splitting it into a series of smaller steps. Setting milestones like this also helps you monitor the progress you’re making.
4. Learn from other people’s experience - The key to humankind’s success has been its ability to build and improve on other people’s inventions and experiences. This applies equally to acquiring and mastering new skills.
5. Learn from experts - Study the experts in your relevant field. Who are the authorities? Why are they so good and what makes them authorities in their subject area? Capitalize on this and use their tricks, tips, experience, and knowledge to expand your skill set.
