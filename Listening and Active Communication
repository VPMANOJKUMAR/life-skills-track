 ### What are the obstacles in your listening process?
 I feel like not focusing too much on what people speaking about any topic and I will be in my world while listening. some times I can't get what they are saying and stuck when they ask the question in writing. more important I feel I will not get their ideas, feeling, and emotions. so, they feel awkward because I did not get into their feeling or emotions. even I don't pretend to them as I am listening to them.
 ### What can you do to improve your listening?
 When you are listening to someone talk, you should avoid looking out a window, texting or scrolling through your phone, or scanning a computer screen. Limit any unnecessary distractions, provide the speaker with your undivided attention, and make an effort to look at them.Try to conjure up mental images of what the speaker is talking about while you are listening to help retain information. This may be a literal picture or other concepts that relate to the topic.You may not understand everything someone says to you. It is best to wait until they pause to ask them to back up and provide clarification for the topic or phrase you misunderstood.
 ## 4. Types of Communication
### +Passive Communication
Individuals who use the passive communication style often act indifferently, yielding to others. Passive communicators usually fail to express their feelings or needs, allowing others to express themselves.
### +Aggressive Communication
Expressing feelings, needs, and ideas at the expense of others; ignoring others' rights in order to support your own. Defensive or hostile when confronted by others. Often alienates and hurts others.
### +Passive Aggressive Communication
Passive-aggressive behavior is a pattern of indirectly expressing negative feelings instead of openly addressing them. There's a disconnect between what a person who exhibits passive-aggressive behavior says and what he or she does.
### +Assertive Communication
expressing your point of view in a way that is clear and direct, while still respecting others. Communicating in an assertive manner can help you to: minimise conflict. control anger.
### when do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?
whenever someone talks badly about me in front of me which is even not correct still I did not get into communicating what is he saying wrong. I still keep mum and do not respond to him. I wanted to get into  that conversation but my mind feels like just leaving it.
### When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?
when  I am talking about more important things with my friends but they do not listen to my word at that of time goes aggressively on my friends and another situation is when I am sharing the most important emotions with my best friend then also when he is not listening to my words means it hurts a lot at that of time anger comes from somewhere else I don't know I go very much harsh on him.
### When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?
even now seriously not done that kind of communication, more I feel others' emotions are very much important when getting closer or being in bonding with someone. I always talk politely with whoever it is. but sometimes I talk with my friend like that to crack a joke with our friend's.
### How can you make your communication assertive? You can analyse the videos and then think what steps you can apply in your own life? (Watch the videos first before answering this question.)
assertive communication is not hurting the feeling of others by expressing our thought and feeling. I follow assertive communication in my communication every day. because my mind feels others' thoughts and feelings are the same as ours. so, I always followed assertive communication knowing or without knowing, as the same way sharing our feeling or thoughts is more important. In sharing our feeling or thoughts it is very much important to more polite and honest. then only the other person in front of me feels comfortable and follows our communication perfectly. when we are sharing an opinion about a person it is more important to talk in assertive communication. so, a person who takes our opinion seriously will feel very much comfortable listening to and accepting opinions about him.
